Three Mechanics:
1. Jumping between platforms
Feeling: Control and satisfaction -> the player feels skillful and in command when landing successful jumps

2. Collecting energy cells
Feeling: Reward and motivation —> picking up items gives a sense of progress and achievement

3. Increasing game speed over time
Feeling: Tension and excitement —> the rising pace creates pressure and keeps the experience thrilling


Removing One Mechanic
Removed Mechanic -> Increasing game speed over time
The game would feel calmer and more predictable Without the rising tension it becomes more relaxed and less exciting, focusing mainly on steady platforming rather than adrenaline and urgency
