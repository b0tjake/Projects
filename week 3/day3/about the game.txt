One-line Game Idea
player jumps between floating platforms to survive as long as possible

Core Elements
goal : stay alive as long as possible while collecting cells to increase score
Rule 1 : if the player falls off the platform the game ends
Rule 2 : the game speed increases over time that makes the jump harder
feedback: each successful jump or collectedd energy cell plays a sound and increase the score

change rule: Instead of the game speeding up over time platforms become smaller
Predicted Experience : The game becomes more skill based and focuses on accuracy instead of reaction speed
