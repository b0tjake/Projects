Game pillars:
Fast paced : The game should feel quick and energetic keeping the player constantly engaged

Challenging : The player must focus and react quickly as the difficulty increases

Satisfying : Each successful jump and collected item should feel rewarding with clear visual and audio feedback

Non-Goal:

No complicated controls : The game should stay simple and intuitive using only one main action "jump"
