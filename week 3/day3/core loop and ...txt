Core gameplay loop :
Do jumps between platforms and collect energy cells
-> Get points and temporary boosts
-> Unlock and Prepare faster speeds or special platform types
-> Repeat

Step Progression
1. Teach
Introduce slow moving platforms in a safe area so the player learns how they move and how to time jumps.

2. Test
Place moving platforms over small gaps where the player must time their jump correctly to continue.

3. Twist
Combine moving platforms with obstacles or faster speeds, forcing the player to react more quickly.

4. Master
Create sections with multiple moving platforms at different speeds and directions, requiring precise timing and full understanding of the mechanic.
