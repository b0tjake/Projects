Goal :
Safely cross as many streets as possible witout getting hit by cars
Rules: 
Cars move fast or slow , traffic lights change , one hit kills you.
core loop:
Observ the traffics -- move forward or wait -- score increases
-----------------------------------------------------------------
feedback: 
if the player successfuly crossed some streets that has some crazy cars ( like buggati ferrari ..) he gets x3 score multiplication

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SCAMPER:
Substitute cars with bikes animals or robots
Combine street crossing with time pressure or collecting items
Adapt ideas from Frogger moving platforms like buses you can stand on
Modify speed streets get narrower. cars faster.
Use the game as a road safety learning tool for the kids
Eliminate traffic lights -> player must rely only on sound and sight
Instead of crossing the street, you control the traffic and kill people who're trying to cross
