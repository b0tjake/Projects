Rapid Prototyping Exercice
chosen mechanic : jump between platforms
prototype: a circle player object - platforms spawning ahead - jump with space - game ends if player falls
FeedBack : the jump feels a bit sucks and slow 
Reflection : the prototype helped to confirm that the core mechanic works but the jump speed need an adjustment to feel smoother and more 
enjoyable
the next step would be to tweak the jump force.
