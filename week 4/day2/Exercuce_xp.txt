2)The Golden Age of Arcades focused on public competition with games like Space Invaders pac-man ..., where people played in social, neon-lit halls. The Modern Era (2000–2010) shifted to private play with games like cs
where players stayed home but connected globally via online microphones.

3)The 16-bit era was dominated by Nintendo and SEGA fighting for the "cool" factor. On the PC side, the decade was defined by Doom, which started the FPS explosion (by stoling it from wolfenstein),
 and StarCraft, which turned strategy into a massive competitive force.

4)Metroidvania uses a big map where you need new powers to explore, like in Hollow Knight.
 JRPGs are story-heavy with turn-based fights like expedition 33.
 RTS is about building bases and armies in real-time, like Age of Empires.
5)The genre evolved from roguelike to roguelite which is more forgiving. In a Roguelite like Hades, 
you keep some rewards after death to buy permanent upgrades, making the player feel progress even after failing, unlike roguelike.

6)The subgenre was defined by the title Dark Souls. To be a "Souls-like," a game must have challenging, deliberate combat that
 punishes mistakes and environmental storytelling where the world itself tells the history through exploration.

7) Hardware evolution allowed for 3D graphics, which let players see deep into the distance and move in any direction. This turned simple levels into massive
 living worlds. The key title that solidified this was Grand Theft Auto III.

8)A community can create a new genre by modding an existing game's files. The MOBA genre was born this way it started as a custom map called Dota
inside the strategy game Warcraft III before becoming its own global phenomenon.

9)Dark Souls influenced the industry by focusing on extreme difficulty and player skill, proving that gamers enjoy overcoming a steep "tough but fair" challenge. In contrast, 
Red Dead Redemption 2 influenced the industry through unprecedented scale and realism; it pushed the "Open-World" genre to its limit by creating a hyper-detailed simulation where the narrative and the environment feel like a living, breathing historical world.
