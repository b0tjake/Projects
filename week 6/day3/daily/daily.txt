Communication Audit
failur "siloed implementation"  - whyIsThisAProblem "The designer pushing a feature without a sync creates hidden work and technical debt/bugs." - immediateImprovement "Mandatory Peer-Review: No feature is merged into the main build without a 5-minute technical sign-off from a developer."
==  "Opaque Task Ownership" -     == "Overlapping tasks suggest team members don't know who is responsible for what, leading to duplicated effort."- == "Centralized Kanban Board: Use a visual tool {like Jira} where every task has exactly one owner and a clear status."
== "Feedback Avoidance" - == "Politeness is causing a buildup of technical errors and resentment, which will eventually explode." - == "Scheduled Post-Mortems: Normalize feedback by making it a standard part of the Friday schedule, removing the "personal" element."

Feedback Exercise
Framework: Observation -> Impact -> Suggestion
Observation: "I noticed that a new gameplay mechanic was added to the build this morning without a prior heads-up or documentation in the sprint log."

Impact: "Because the development team wasn't aware, it conflicted with the existing physics code, resulting in a critical bug that halted our testing for two hours."

Suggestion: "In the future, could you post a quick summary in the dev-sync channel before pushing new logic? This allows us to flag potential conflicts before they break the build."


Stress & Collaboration Solution
Main Stress Factor: Cognitive Overload & Role Ambiguity
Practical Strategies to Reduce Stress
To combat the feeling of being overwhelmed, the developer commits to finishing 1 Big Task, 3 Medium Tasks, and 5 Small Tasks per day. Anything else is bonus which provides a psychological sense of completion.
To lower the pressure of perfection the developer should use simple primitives (cubes/spheres) to test logic first. This separates making it work from making it pretty, reducing the immediate mental load

Team Leader Action
The leader should mandate that no feature can move from the Design phase to the Dev phase unless it meets three criteria:
-It has been discussed in a 10-minute handoff meeting.
-The technical dependencies have been identified.
-The developer has confirmed they have the bandwidth to take it on.
