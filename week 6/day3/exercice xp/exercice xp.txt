Producer : Timeline management, removing blockers and obstacles and cross-team communication.
Designer : Gameplay mechanics UI/UX flow and balancing documentation.
Developer : Core system coding and bug fixing and implementation of assets.
Artist : Visual asset creation (2D/3D)/assets, UI elements, and aesthetic consistency.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Communication Infrastructure

Discord : Day-to-day coordination and quick questions.
Jira : Centralized documentation and task tracking.
Email: Formal updates for external stakeholders.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Communication Plan

Daily 15min Stand-up : Sync on? What did I do? What will I do? What is blocking me?

Weekly 1h Sprint Review : Demo the current build and adjust the roadmap.

Documentation "Pulse": End-of-day updates to the task board to ensure clarity for the next morning.


===========================
Exercise 2: Feedback & Iteration
===========================
Observation: State the specific behavior or feature.

Impact: Explain how this affects the player or the project.

Suggestion: Offer a path forward.

I observed that the character takes 0.5 seconds to start moving after the input.
The impact is that the controls feel 'mushy' and unresponsive during combat.
I suggest we remove the startup animation frames to make the movement instantaneous.

Separate Identity from Output: Remind the team that {The code is not the coder}. We are critiquing the work, not the person.
The "Yes, And" Approach: Instead of shutting down ideas, build on them to find a middle ground.
Scheduled Feedback Loops: Feedback shouldn't be a surprise; it should happen during designated review windows.


===================================
exercice 3
===================================
main sources of stress :
Ambiguous Ownership - Scope Creep - Communication Overload

Ambiguous Ownership => {
RACI Matrix: Clearly define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for every task.
Visual Task Board: Use a Kanban board (Jira/Trello) so everyone sees "Who is doing What" in real-time.
}

Scope Creep
The "Kill List": Identify "nice-to-have" features early and cut them the moment a milestone is threatened.
Time-Boxing: Limit specific tasks (e.g., polishing a menu) to a strict 4-hour window to prevent over-working.
}

Communication Overload => {
Deep Work Blocks: Schedule 3-hour "No-Meeting" windows daily to allow for flow state.
Communication Hierarchy: Move non-urgent "FYIs" to documentation rather than interrupting via chat.
}
conflict : the late delivery standoff

The Developer expresses frustration during a meeting, claiming they can’t finish the prototype because the Artist is "lazy."
The Artist fires back that the Developer's technical requirements are too confusing and changing constantly.

Conflict Type: Process Conflict
Resolution steps : Define the Bottleneck - Establish "Minimum Viable Assets" - Formalize the Hand-off - The "Early Warning" Rule

Leadership Behavior: The Process Architect
