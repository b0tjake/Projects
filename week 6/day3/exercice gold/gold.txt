Exercise 1 
1- we gonna use RACI natrix

                    	Designer               Developer          Artist              Producer
Player Controller	A/R (Feel/Specs)       C (Physics)	  I (Animations)       I
Asset Pipeline		I	               A/R (Integration   R (Creation)	       C (Deadlines)
UI/UX Menu		R (Wireframes)	       C (Logic)	  A/R (Visuals)	       I

Key Bottleneck: The Artist is a "Single Point of Failure." If Asset Creation stops, the Developer cannot perform Integration.

multi-layered communication system:

Layer 1: Sync (The Pulse): Daily 15-minute standing meeting. Strictly: Done, Doing, Blocked.

Layer 2: Async (The Record): All design decisions must be logged in a Decision Log . If it isn't written down, it didn't happen.

Layer 3: Emergency (The Flare): A dedicated "Blocker" channel in Slack/Discord. Tagging a Lead here means work has stopped.



Risk Mitigation Plan

Failure: A Lead is unavailable for a critical decision.

Mitigation: The 24 Hour Rule -> If a blocker isnt addressed in 24 hours => the sub-team proceeds with the most reversible option to maintain momentum.


							Exercice 2
Tiered Feedback Framework : 

Peer-to-Peer: Informal, technical, and immediate. focus on "how?"

Cross-Discipline : Artist to Dev, focus on the impact (FOR EX, "This texture size slows down my build time").

Lead-to-Team : High-level alignment. focus on "goal" (FOR EX, "This mechanic doesn't fit the 'Horror' theme").


Feedback Examples

on the gameplay mechanics => The jump height makes the level feel small. Can we reduce it by 15%?

Technical Implementation: The current script calls Update funcrtion every frame, causing lag . isnt it better ti move this to an Event-based system ."

							Exercice 3

stress factors -> Technical - Deadline - Interpersonal - Personal

solutions 
Technical => Localized testing - Peer-coding sessions - Temporary Feature Freeze.
Deadline => Task Sandboxing - Re-prioritizing the MVP - Cutting non-essential polish.
Interpersonal => 1-on-1 vent sessions - Conflict mediation - Role re-alignment.
Personal => Mandatory the {Off-grid time} - Flexible core hours - Mental health check-ins.

Critical Conflict: The Late Asset Delivery(Again hh)
Conflict Type: Process & Interpersonal.

Resolution Strategy : 

Neutral Ground: Meet without screens.
Technical Spec: The Dev defines the minimum needed (FOR EX, Just the .FBX file, no textures).
Deadline Buffer: The Artist agrees to a Rough delivery 48 hours before the Final delivery.

Leadership Approach

Protect the team from outside pressure so they can focus
Clean up administrative tasks so the creators can create.
During break no project talk
